===================
MARLEY Bibliography
===================

This bibliography attempts to collect a full list of (1) references discussing
MARLEY itself and (2) publications that use MARLEY calculations in some way.
Examples of the latter category include

* New results (e.g., experimental sensitivity estimates) obtained using MARLEY
  simulations

* Comparisons of MARLEY to competing theoretical models

User contributions to this list are strongly encouraged. If you have written a
publication, thesis, etc. in which MARLEY is used, please `send me
<./contact.html>`_ a citation (`BibTeX <http://www.bibtex.org>`_ format
preferred) to advertise on this page. If your work is not openly accessible
online, please also include a copy or preprint of the document together with
the citation.
